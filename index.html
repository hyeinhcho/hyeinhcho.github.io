                <p id="abstract1" class="abstract">I examine how integration between healthcare providers and insurers affects care delivery. Unlike stand-alone providers, integrated providers bear financial responsibility as insurers, which may incentivize them to limit resource-intensive services or better coordinate care. In the Massachusetts Individual Exchange, I find that integration reduces utilization, mainly by reducing patients' visits to specialists. Integration lowers both the likelihood of patients visiting a specialist by 10 percentage points and, for those who do, the likelihood of seeking second opinions by 2.5 percentage points. This shift is driven by integrated insurers reallocating patients to new primary care practitioners (PCPs) who are more likely to be integrated with the insurer. To assess whether the reduction in specialist visits stems from integrated PCPs' stricter gatekeeping or improved PCP-specialist coordination, I develop and estimate a physician referral model. Counterfactual analyses reveal that 86% of the variation is explained by gatekeeping.</p>

                <p id="abstract2" class="abstract">We examine whether policies that affect the extent of for-profit versus not-for-profit provision in regulated markets such as health and education can be effective at addressing quality shortfalls. We study the question in the context of the US nursing home industry, where significant quality shortfalls have been persistent for many decades despite a long history of other policy reforms, and policymakers have recently considered policies limiting the extent of for-profit provision. Our motivating evidence suggests that not-for-profit providers choose higher-quality inputs. However, for-profit providers play an important role in providing access to nursing home services by serving the majority of markets, systematically locating in lower socioeconomic areas, and serving needier residents. To study the welfare effects of limiting for-profit provision, we develop a two-stage static model of oligopoly competition and entry. We find that not-for-profit nursing homes maximize both profit and non-pecuniary objectives but have higher costs.</p>

                <p id="abstract3" class="abstract">As the world population ages, it is increasingly important to understand efficient ways to deliver long-term care. I compare the value of two approaches: facility-based care and home-based care. To control for patients' selection into different types of care, I exploit a natural experiment in the South Korean national long-term care insurance scheme and its detailed administrative data. I find that facility-based care increases first-year mortality by 19% for compliers, compared to home-based care. Death is concentrated among individuals who have had physical impairment and access to informal care at the point of moving into facilities. I document two potential mechanisms: (1) poor quality facility care caused by understaffing or negligence, resulting in life-threatening conditions and (2) residents losing a sense of community, taking a toll on the physical health of the old and frail population. Moreover, expanding home-based care improves chronic care management, without increasing spending. These findings suggest policies subsidizing home-based care would generate better health outcomes at lower costs. </p>
